        /// 
        /// PROBLEM: Multiple departments can take the same course (e.g., MTH101 for CS, CYS, EE)
        /// Each department's course rep needs to start separate attendance sessions for their students
        /// 
        /// PROPOSED SOLUTION:
        /// 1. Modify Firebase collection structure:
        ///    - Current: /attendance/{courseCode}/{sessionId}
        ///    - New: /attendance/{departmentCode}/{courseCode}/{sessionId}
        ///    - Example: /attendance/CS/MTH101/session123, /attendance/CYS/MTH101/session456
        /// 
        /// 2. Extract department from matric number:
        ///    - U21CYS1080 -> CYS (Cyber Security)
        ///    - U21CS1090 -> CS (Computer Science)
        ///    - U21EE1050 -> EE (Electrical Engineering)
        ///    - Create utility method: ExtractDepartmentFromMatric(string matricNumber)
        /// 
        /// 3. Update session creation to include department context:
        ///    - Modify SessionData to include DepartmentCode
        ///    - Update QR code payload to include department identifier
        ///    - Ensure students can only scan QR for their department's session
